### About me
 > I have been working in the **IT industry since 2006**. My first and  current company is "TOP SOFT". We develop and implement enterprise management systems. I participated in many projects and solved various tasks. The biggest project, both in terms of volume and duration, is the implementation of our developments in the company "Transneft". At one stage of the "Transneft" project, I led the development and implementation of the Rights and Powers subsystem. The difficulty was that the new system of rights was launched when users were already working for a long time, and there was a lot of work to reconfigure user rights. Me and my team did it. As a project Manager, I managed 100%. Now I want to try myself as a developer.
